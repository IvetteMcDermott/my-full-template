# My Very first website

Welcome!  [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

This has been a guided project, my very first website.

It had been developed while in the process of learning to use Gitpod and GitHub. 

The page deploys a variety of options for getting information about different languages and tools for coding. 

For this project, I used HTML and CSS according to the videos of guidance.The information shown in it comes from Wikipedia, official pages of sites, applications, etc. that are deployed on the page.
